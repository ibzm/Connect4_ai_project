# Connect 4 AI Project

This project is a Python-based implementation of Connect 4 with multiple AI agents. It supports human play, random decisions, rule-based strategies, minimax search, and machine learning-based predictions. The game board is a 6x7 grid where two players take turns dropping discs (‘●’ for Player 1, ‘○’ for Player 2) until someone wins or the board is full.

## Features

- Fully working 6x7 Connect 4 game
- Turn-by-turn board display
- Win checks (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Draw detection
- 6 player types:
  - Human
  - Random Agent
  - Smart Agent (rule-based)
  - Minimax Agent
  - Machine Learning Agent (UCI dataset semi functioning)
  - ML Agent 2 (trained from minimax-generated states semi functioning) 

## Installation

Install Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tqdm

```
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tqdm

```
